## Hi there 👋 I’m Nouman Shakeel!

I’m a 5th-semester BS Information Technology student passionate about **Cloud Architecture** and **Machine Learning**. My goal is to become a skilled Cloud Architect and ML expert, building scalable systems and intelligent solutions that make an impact. I’m currently diving into the fundamentals of cloud computing and exploring platforms like AWS

### 🔭 What I’m Working On
- Learning the basics of Cloud Architecture, starting with concepts like IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, and setting up my AWS free-tier account as part of a 12-week mastery course.
- Exploring small projects to apply my skills in cloud computing and prepare for ML applications.

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Cloud computing fundamentals: service models, deployment models (public, private, hybrid), and key characteristics like rapid elasticity.
- Foundations of Machine Learning, aiming to understand data preprocessing and model deployment on cloud platforms.

### 👯 I’d Love to Collaborate On
- Cloud-based projects, especially those involving AWS or Google Cloud, to design scalable architectures.
- Machine Learning projects that involve data preprocessing, model building, or deployment on cloud platforms.
- Open-source contributions where I can learn from and contribute to the community.

### 🤔 I’m Looking for Help With
- Practical tips on deploying ML models on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.
- Guidance on optimizing cloud architectures for cost, scalability, and security.
- Resources or mentorship to bridge my Cloud Architecture and Machine Learning goals.
