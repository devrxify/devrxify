## Hi there 👋 I’m Nouman Shakeel!

I’m a 4th-semester BS Information Technology student passionate about **Cloud Architecture** and **Machine Learning**. My goal is to become a skilled Cloud Architect and ML expert, building scalable systems and intelligent solutions that make an impact. I’m currently diving into the fundamentals of cloud computing, exploring platforms like AWS, and sharpening my skills in data structures and algorithms to support my CA and ML journey.

### 🔭 What I’m Working On
- Learning the basics of Cloud Architecture, starting with concepts like IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, and setting up my AWS free-tier account as part of a 12-week mastery course.
- Exploring small projects to apply my skills in cloud computing and prepare for ML applications.

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Cloud computing fundamentals: service models, deployment models (public, private, hybrid), and key characteristics like rapid elasticity.
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to strengthen my programming foundation—recently explored priority queues and DFAs.
- Foundations of Machine Learning, aiming to understand data preprocessing and model deployment on cloud platforms.

### 👯 I’d Love to Collaborate On
- Cloud-based projects, especially those involving AWS or Google Cloud, to design scalable architectures.
- Machine Learning projects that involve data preprocessing, model building, or deployment on cloud platforms.
- Open-source contributions where I can learn from and contribute to the community.

### 🤔 I’m Looking for Help With
- Practical tips on deploying ML models on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.
- Guidance on optimizing cloud architectures for cost, scalability, and security.
- Resources or mentorship to bridge my Cloud Architecture and Machine Learning goals.
